    <p>The story revolves around three pigs, but we also have an antagonist, the wolf, who symbolises life’s challenges, negativity, and hardships. Every character has its trait. The first two pigs showcase the shortcomings of lazy behaviour and an ‘I don’t care’ attitude. In contrast, the third pig establishes the positive side of being a hard worker and a planner in life.</p>

    <p>Once upon a time, there lived an old mother pig. She had three little pigs. One day she decided to send them on their way to lead their lives on their own. “Go and seek your own destiny and fortune” the mother said, and the little pigs went their ways.
The first pig was very lazy. “I’ll build my house with straws”, he decided as he chose the easy way. He got the straw from a farmer and started building.        
The second pig said “I will make my house with sticks.” He got the sticks from a woodcutter and began building.
 The third pig was laborious and intelligent. “I will make my house using bricks” he said, and got the materials from a builder pushing a cart of bricks.
“Your materials seem weak, and your house won’t be strong”, said the little pic to his brothers, as he was concerned that their construction would not be sturdy enough. He said, “Listen, brothers, we should make a strong house, which can save us from any danger.”
The other two pigs said, “You do it your way, and we will make our houses our way. Anyways, those bricks look very heavy. So much labour and so much work – not for us. You continue.”
 They ignored his advice and constructed their houses the way they wanted.
          Soon, all three pigs built their houses and were pleased about it.After some time, a wolf passed the lane of these pigs’ houses. He saw the house made up of straws and a pig playing nearby. The wolf decided to him. The moment the pig saw the wolf, he ran inside the house in fear. Then, the wolf knocked on the door and said, “Little pig! Little pig! Won’t you let me in?”
But, the pig refused and replied, “No! No! No! Not by the hair on my chinny chin chin!”Then the wolf grinned and said, “Then I’ll huff, and I’ll puff, and I’ll blow your house in.” He did what he said, and he blew the house away. Seeing this, the first pig ran towards the second pig’s house to hide.The wolf followed him along and found the second pig’s house.
He knocked on the door again and said, “Little pigs! Little pigs! Won’t you let me in?”After seeing the scary teeth of the wolf, both the pigs replied, “No! No! No! Not by the hair on our chinny chin chin!”Then again, the wolf laughed in satire and said, “Then I’ll huff, and I’ll puff, and I’ll blow your house in.” And he did just that.
Realising what was happening, both the pigs escaped to the third pig’s house.
        
        The wolf followed them and reached the third pig house.Now, the wolf knocked on the door again and said, ‘Little pigs! Little pigs! Let me in! Let me in!’But the frightened pigs answered back, ‘No! No! No! Not by the hair on our chinny chin chin!’
Then the wolf laughed cunningly and threatened, ‘Then I’ll huff, and I’ll puff, and I’ll blow your house in.’The big bad wolf tried to bring the house down and huff and puff again and again, but it was of no use. The frustrated wolf attempted to make a forceful entry from the chimney, but the intelligent third pig boiled a large pot of water and placed it below the chimney. The wolf fell inside the pot, hurt himself, and ran away in a jiffy. The three pigs were overjoyed!
        The other two pigs praised the third pig for his hard work, practicality and intelligence..</p>
